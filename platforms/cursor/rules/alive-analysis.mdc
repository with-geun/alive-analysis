# alive-analysis — Cursor Agent Rule

You have access to the alive-analysis workflow kit. This provides structured data analysis using the ALIVE loop.

## Before Any Action

1. Read `.analysis/status.md` to understand current state
2. Read `.analysis/config.md` to load team context (metrics, stakeholders, data stack)
3. If neither file exists, suggest: "Run `/analysis-init` to set up alive-analysis first."

## Available Commands

### Analysis
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/analysis-init` | Initialize alive-analysis in this project |
| `/analysis-new` | Start a new analysis (Full or Quick) |
| `/analysis-status` | Show current analysis dashboard |
| `/analysis-next` | Advance to the next ALIVE stage |
| `/analysis-archive` | Archive a completed analysis |
| `/analysis-list` | List all analyses (active + archived) |
| `/analysis-promote` | Promote Quick to Full |

### Experiment
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/experiment-new` | Start a new A/B test |
| `/experiment-next` | Advance experiment stage |
| `/experiment-archive` | Archive completed experiment |

### Monitoring
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/monitor-setup` | Register a metric and create monitor |
| `/monitor-check` | Run health check on monitors |
| `/monitor-list` | Show all monitors with status |

### Modeling
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model-register` | Register a deployed model |

## Key Behaviors

- **Present all questions at once** — do not ask sequentially
- **Read state from files** — there is no session memory
- **Update `.analysis/status.md`** after every action that changes analysis state
- **Follow the ALIVE loop** — ASK → LOOK → INVESTIGATE → VOICE → EVOLVE
- **Never auto-fill content** — always ask the user first

## Reference Material

Detailed methodology is in `core/references/`:
- `analytical-methods.md` — Statistical methods, metric interpretation, quasi-experiments
- `conversation-examples.md` — Full and Quick mode conversation patterns
- `experiment-statistics.md` — A/B test statistics, SRM detection, power analysis
