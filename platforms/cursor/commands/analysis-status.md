# /analysis status

Show current analysis status dashboard.

## Instructions

**Before executing**: Read `.analysis/status.md` and `.analysis/config.md` to load current state.

### Step 1: Read status.md

Read `.analysis/status.md` and parse the Active, Recently Archived, and Pending sections.

### Step 2: Validate against actual files

Cross-check status.md against actual files in `analyses/active/`:
- If a file exists in active/ but not in status.md -> warn "untracked analysis"
- If status.md lists an analysis but file is missing -> warn "stale entry"

### Step 3: Display dashboard

Format output as a clean dashboard:

```
===================================================
  alive-analysis Status Dashboard
===================================================

  Active Analyses (3)
  -------------------
  F-2026-0210-001  DAU drop investigation     @ye   ASK     [retention, mobile]
  Q-2026-0210-002  Retention check            @ye   VOICE   [retention, onboarding]

  Q-2026-0207-001  Sign-up conversion -> "Mobile 30% lower"

  Pending (1)
  -----------

===================================================
```

### Step 4: Stage icons reference

Use these icons for each ALIVE stage:
```
ASK -> LOOK -> INVESTIGATE -> VOICE -> EVOLVE
```

Completed/archived: done
Pending: waiting

### Step 5: Suggestions

Based on the current state, suggest next actions:
- If any analysis is in VOICE/EVOLVE -> "Consider archiving with `/analysis archive`"
- If no active analyses -> "Start a new analysis with `/analysis new`"
- If analyses are stale (>7 days in same stage) -> "Consider reviewing stalled analyses"

**After executing**: Update `.analysis/status.md` with any state changes.
