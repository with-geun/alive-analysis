# /analysis next

Advance the current analysis to the next ALIVE stage.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify current analysis

Read `.analysis/status.md` to find active analyses.

- If only 1 active Full analysis → select it automatically
- If multiple active → ask user which analysis to advance (show ID + title)
- Quick analyses don't use `/analysis next` (all sections are in one file)
  - If user selects a Quick, remind them to fill sections in order within the file

### Step 2: Determine current stage

Read the analysis folder to see which stage files exist:
- Only `01_ask.md` → current stage is ASK
- Up to `02_look.md` → current stage is LOOK
- Up to `03_investigate.md` → current stage is INVESTIGATE
- Up to `04_voice.md` → current stage is VOICE
- All 5 files exist → current stage is EVOLVE (analysis is complete)

### Step 3: Review current stage checklist

Read the current stage's checklist (embedded at the bottom of the current stage file).

Check if there are any 🔴 (stop) items:
- If 🔴 items exist → warn the user: "There are stop signals in your {stage} checklist. Review before proceeding."
- If all items are unchecked → remind: "Don't forget to review the checklist before moving on."
- If items are checked → proceed

### Step 4: Generate next stage file

Based on current stage, generate the next file.

**ASK → LOOK** (generate `02_look.md`):

**Note:** If this is a 📈 Modeling analysis, use the Modeling-specific templates defined in `analysis-new.md` Section 4B instead of the Investigation templates below. This applies to LOOK, INVESTIGATE, VOICE, and EVOLVE stages. If this is a 🔮 Simulation analysis, use the Simulation-specific templates from `analysis-new.md` Section 4D for all stages.

```markdown
# LOOK: {title}
> ID: {ID} | Type: 🔍 Investigation | Stage: 👀 LOOK | Updated: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Data Sources
- Primary:
- Secondary:
- Access method: (MCP / exported file / manual query / BI dashboard)

## Data Quality Review
- Row count:
- Date range:
- Missing values:
- Known issues:

## Segmentation
Break down BEFORE drawing conclusions:
- By time:
- By cohort:
- By platform:
- By segment:

Key question: "Does the pattern hold across ALL segments, or is it driven by one?"

## Confounding Variables
- What else changed at the same time?
- Population comparison: Are we comparing the same groups?
- Survivorship bias risk:
- Simpson's paradox check:

## External Factors
- Calendar: holidays, seasonality, industry events
- Competitors: recent launches, pricing changes
- Platform: iOS/Android policy, algorithm updates
- Macro: economic indicators, regulation changes

## Cross-Service Check
- Related services that may be affected:
- Shared resources (auth, data pipeline, user base):
- Recent changes in adjacent services:

## Outliers & Anomalies

## Sampling
- Method:
- Size:
- Rationale:

**LOOK → INVESTIGATE** (generate `03_investigate.md`):
```markdown
# INVESTIGATE: {title}
> ID: {ID} | Type: 🔍 Investigation | Stage: 🔍 INVESTIGATE | Updated: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Hypothesis Scorecard
| # | Hypothesis | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Status | Contribution |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | | | | ✅/❌/⚠️ | ~%  |
| 2 | | | | ✅/❌/⚠️ | ~%  |
| 3 | | | | ✅/❌/⚠️ | ~%  |

Strategy: Test the easiest-to-disprove hypotheses first.

## Multi-Lens Analysis

### Macro (market/industry)
- Industry-wide trend?
- Competitor actions?

- Cohort-specific trends:
- Edge cases:

## Causation vs Correlation
(Fill if causal claims are being made)
- Time ordering: Did cause precede effect?
- Mechanism: Plausible pathway?
- Dose-response: More cause → more effect?
- Counterfactual: Control group / unaffected segment?
- Conclusion: Causal / Correlational / Inconclusive

{Insert EVOLVE checklist from .analysis/checklists/evolve.md}
```

**EVOLVE reached** → Tell user:
"This analysis is complete. Run `/analysis archive` to archive it."

### Step 5: Update status.md

- Change the stage column to the new stage icon
- Update "Last updated" timestamp

### Step 6: Confirmation

Tell the user:
- Advanced from {old stage} to {new stage}
- Show the new file path
- Remind them to fill in the content and review the checklist
- If VOICE: "After completing VOICE and EVOLVE, run `/analysis archive`"
