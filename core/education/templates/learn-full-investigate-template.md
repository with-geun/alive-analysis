## Hypothesis Scorecard
| # | Hypothesis | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Status | Contribution |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | | | | ✅/❌/⚠️ | ~%  |
| 2 | | | | ✅/❌/⚠️ | ~%  |
| 3 | | | | ✅/❌/⚠️ | ~%  |

Strategy: Test the easiest-to-disprove hypotheses first.

## Multi-Lens Analysis

### Macro (market/industry)
- Industry-wide trend?
- Competitor actions?
- Economic/regulatory factors?

### Meso (company/product)
- Cross-service impact?
- Channel mix shift?
- Product changes (releases, A/B tests)?

### Micro (user/session)
- User behavior patterns:
- Cohort-specific trends:
- Edge cases:

## Causation vs Correlation
(Fill if causal claims are being made)
- Time ordering: Did cause precede effect?
- Mechanism: Plausible pathway?
- Dose-response: More cause → more effect?
- Counterfactual: Control group / unaffected segment?
- Conclusion: Causal / Correlational / Inconclusive

## Results
