# Hints: ASK Stage

## Level 1 (Direction)
Think about what TYPE of question this is. Is it about WHY something happened (causation) or whether two things are related (correlation)?

## Level 2 (Specific)
This is a causal question: "Why did signups drop?" Your hypotheses should cover: (1) something changed internally (product, tracking), (2) something changed externally (market, competitors), (3) a data artifact (tracking broke).

## Level 3 (Near-answer)
Frame as: Causation — "What caused the 30% signup drop on Feb 18?"
Key hypotheses:
1. Internal: Android v2.8 release (Feb 17) introduced a breaking change
2. Internal: Server or tracking issue
3. External: Seasonal or competitive factor
4. Data: GA4 tracking change
