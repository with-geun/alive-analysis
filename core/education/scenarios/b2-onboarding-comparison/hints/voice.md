# Hints: VOICE Stage

## Level 1 — Direction
This analysis has two findings that point in different directions. Your recommendation should not pretend that one side does not exist. The PM needs to understand the trade-off, not just the winner.

## Level 2 — Specific
Structure your recommendation around the tension:
- **Good news**: Flow B converts 6pp better, consistently, across all channels
- **Caution**: Flow B users activate 1–3pp less often in the first 7 days, also consistently across all channels

The PM needs to decide which matters more — more users getting in, or the same quality of users getting in. Your job is not to make that business decision for them; it is to make the trade-off visible and give them a path that manages the downside.

Also calibrate your confidence separately for each finding:
- Signup improvement: High confidence (large combined n, consistent across all segments)
- Activation gap: Medium confidence (smaller per-segment activated user counts, 2-week window is short)

## Level 3 — Near-answer
A strong VOICE answer for this scenario looks like:

**So What**: Flow B converts 6pp better across all channels by removing the phone verification friction point. However, Flow B users show 1–3pp lower D7 activation per segment, suggesting the easier entry may be attracting slightly lower-intent users.

**Now What**: Ship Flow B to 100% — the conversion improvement is real and the activation gap is small. Set a monitoring alert: if D7 activation for Flow B users drops more than 3pp compared to the Flow A baseline after 30 days at full traffic, add optional phone verification back as a trust signal.

**Confidence**: High for the signup improvement (n=10,450, all segments consistent). Medium for the activation gap (pattern is consistent but the absolute gap is small and the window is short).

Avoid presenting this as a clear win or a clear problem. It is a trade-off, and the nuanced answer is the correct one.
