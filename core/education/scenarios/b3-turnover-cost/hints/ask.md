# Hints: ASK Stage

## Level 1 (Direction)
Think about what TYPE of analysis is being requested. Is the CFO asking "why did turnover increase?" or "how much is it costing us and where should we focus?" Those are different questions with different framings.

## Level 2 (Specific)
This is a Quantification + Segmentation question, not a pure causation question. The HR Director already knows turnover went up — the CFO needs dollar amounts and priorities. Frame it as: "What is the total financial cost of turnover AND where is that cost concentrated by level?"

Identify the two things you need to answer:
1. Total cost (multiplication: departures × cost per head, by level)
2. Where the problem is most severe (which level drove the increase the most?)

## Level 3 (Near-answer)
Frame as: Investigation (Quantification) — "What is the total cost of engineering turnover this year, and which level is the highest-impact segment to address?"

Key sub-questions:
1. What is the total replacement cost by level? (Look stage: arithmetic)
2. Which level had the biggest increase relative to baseline? (Segmentation)
3. What is driving the increase at each level? (Investigate stage: root causes differ)
4. What is the ROI of a retention program? (Voice stage: CFO framing)

Note: The audience is the CFO, not the HR Director. Lead with cost and ROI, not with employee sentiment.
