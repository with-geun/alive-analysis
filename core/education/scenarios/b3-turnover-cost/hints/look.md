# Hints: LOOK Stage

## Level 1 (Direction)
Don't just look at the turnover percentages — percentages alone don't tell you the financial story. You need to combine two pieces of information to get the real number. What are they?

## Level 2 (Specific)
Multiply departures by replacement cost per head at each level. That gives you the actual dollar impact per segment. Then compare: which level has the highest total cost? The answer might surprise you — it's not necessarily the level with the most departures or the highest percentage increase.

Also check the external factors. Competitors raised salaries 15% in Q3. Does that explain the whole picture, or only part of it?

## Level 3 (Near-answer)
Cost calculation:
- Junior: 26 departures × $35K = **$910K**
- Mid: 17 departures × $80K = **$1,360K**
- Senior: 5 departures × $150K = **$750K**
- Total: **$3.02M**

Mid-level is the biggest cost driver ($1.36M) despite having fewer departures than Junior (17 vs 26). This is because mid-level replacement cost is more than double that of junior. The percentage increase for Mid (10% → 20%, doubled) is also the most dramatic change from last year.

External factor note: The competitor salary increases may partly explain Junior and Senior movement, but Mid's pattern (70% citing career path, not compensation) suggests something internal. Don't let the external news story explain away the Mid-level problem.
