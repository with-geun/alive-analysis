# Scenario Briefing: "Why did signups drop yesterday?"

## Your Role
You are a data analyst at **AppFlow**, a B2C mobile app with 50K DAU. The PM has pinged you on Slack:

> "Hey, signups yesterday (Feb 18) dropped about 30% compared to the day before. The CEO noticed and is asking. Can you figure out what happened? We need something by end of day."

## Context
- AppFlow has iOS, Android, and Web signup flows
- A new version (v2.8) was released on Feb 17 for Android only
- The app uses GA4 for event tracking and has server-side signup logs
- Marketing ran no special campaigns this week
- Yesterday was a Tuesday (normal weekday)

## Available Data
You have access to:
1. **GA4 event data** — signup funnel events by platform, daily
2. **Server logs** — signup completion records with timestamps and error codes
3. **Release notes** — v2.8 changelog (Android)

## Your Task
Use the ALIVE loop to investigate the signup drop and provide an actionable recommendation.

## Deadline
End of day (this is a Quick analysis)
