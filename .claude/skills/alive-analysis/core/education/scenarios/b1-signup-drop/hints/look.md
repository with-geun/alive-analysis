# Hints: LOOK Stage

## Level 1 (Direction)
Don't just look at the total. Break it down by platform — the drop might not be uniform.

## Level 2 (Specific)
Compare iOS, Android, and Web separately. One platform dropped dramatically while the others are nearly unchanged. Which one?

## Level 3 (Near-answer)
Android signups dropped from ~305 to ~120 (−61%). iOS and Web are roughly flat. The funnel shows a massive drop-off at the "Password set" step on Android (640 → 180, vs iOS 420 → 390). Something is blocking Android users at password entry.
