# VOICE — Should We Lower Delivery Fees?

## Executive Summary (30-Second Version)

**The fee reduction from ₩3,000 to ₩1,500 is a high-risk move that requires sustained +32% order growth to fully break even — well above what our promo data supports (+15% sustained). The downside in the first 12 months ranges from −₩150M to −₩400M/month depending on scenario. We recommend a phased test before any company-wide rollout.**

## 3-Scenario Summary Table

| | Conservative | Neutral | Aggressive |
|-|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Sustained order increase** | +12% | +18% | +25% |
| **Monthly orders** | 504,000 | 531,000 | 562,500 |
| **Net monthly P&L vs baseline** | −₩334M | −₩255M | −₩148M |
| **Annual P&L impact** | −₩4.0B | −₩3.1B | −₩1.8B |
| **vs breakeven (simple)** | Below | Below | Below |
| **Rider capacity (max 18K/day)** | OK — 16,800/day (93%) | Tight — 17,700/day (98%) | Exceeded — 18,750/day |
| **Pre-hire needed?** | No | Monitor closely | Yes — immediately |
| **Likely if:** | Competitor matches quickly, promo effect fades fast | Promo week 4 sustained, some competitor lag | No competitor response, strong long-run elasticity |

## Breakeven Explanation (For the CFO)

"Our current delivery fee revenue is ₩972M/month on non-subscriber orders. If we cut the fee by ₩1,500, we lose that ₩486M in fee revenue on existing orders — before counting any benefit from new orders.

Each new order we attract brings in ₩3,050 in net margin (commission + new fee − rider cost). To recover the ₩486M lost on existing orders, we need approximately 59,000 new orders per month, or **+13% order growth** — just to break even on the incremental math.

But this doesn't account for the fee cut we're also giving to existing non-subscriber orders. Once you include the revenue loss on ALL non-subscriber orders (existing + new), breakeven requires closer to **+32% sustained growth** — meaningfully above what our 4-week promo showed at week 4 (+15%).

The numbers are harder than the headline promo looks."

## Handle Bars (For Board Discussion)

Present these as adjustable assumptions the board can stress-test live:

| Input | Base Case | Change It To | P&L Impact |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Sustained order increase | +18% | +10% → −₩400M/month | +30% → −₩80M/month |
| Subscription conversion suppression | −1pp over 12 months | −3pp → −₩120M/yr additional | 0pp → no change |
| Rider variable cost discount | −5% at +18% vol | 0% → −₩35M/month | −10% → +₩30M/month |
| Competitor response speed | 2 weeks | Never responds → +60M/month | Immediate → −₩80M/month |

**Board question to anticipate**: "What if we grow to 25% and competitors don't respond?" → Answer: Still −₩148M/month vs current baseline in Year 1. The volume math alone doesn't rescue the P&L in the short term.

## Phased Recommendation

**Do not implement the full ₩1,500 cut company-wide immediately.**

**Proposed 3-phase approach:**

### Phase 1: Test (Weeks 1-4)
- Reduce fee to ₩2,000 (−33%, not −50%) in one city (recommend: Busan)
- Full rollout of ₩1,500 remains paused
- Measure: daily orders, AOV, subscription conversion, rider utilization
- Go/No-Go threshold: Sustained +10% order increase by week 4

### Phase 2: Evaluate and Scale (Weeks 5-8)
- If Phase 1 hits threshold: Roll out ₩2,000 fee nationwide
- Simultaneously: Model ₩1,500 based on Phase 1 elasticity data (real data, not promo proxy)
- If Phase 1 misses threshold: Hold at ₩3,000, run competitor analysis

### Phase 3: Full Decision (Week 9+)
- If nationwide ₩2,000 data is positive AND competitor response is manageable: move to ₩1,500
- Set KPI gates: Cannot proceed without confirming +15% sustained order growth

**This approach gives the CEO a "yes, we're moving" story while giving the CFO a floor on downside.**

## Audience-Specific Messages

### CEO — Growth Story
"The opportunity is real: our promo proved that lower fees drive order volume. A phased rollout starting at ₩2,000 in one city gives us real elasticity data in 4 weeks, positions us against Competitor A immediately, and sets up a full ₩1,500 rollout if results hold. We move now, we learn fast."

### CFO — Risk and Breakeven
"The fee reduction is P&L negative under every scenario in the first 12 months based on current data. The promo showed +15% sustained volume — we need +13% just to cover the incremental math, and +32% to fully break even on total non-subscriber revenue. The phased test limits our exposure to one market while giving us the data to build the full business case with real numbers, not promo proxies."

### Head of Operations — Capacity Plan
"Neutral scenario (+18% orders) puts us at 98% of rider capacity — that's a critical alert threshold, not comfortable operations. Aggressive scenario exceeds our fleet ceiling. If leadership decides to go forward, we need to begin rider onboarding now. Lead time is 3-4 weeks. We should not announce the fee change until we have 20K/day capacity confirmed. For Phase 1 (Busan only), we have sufficient local capacity."

## Confidence and Uncertainty Statement

**Confidence in scenario structure**: High — the model correctly captures the key economic levers.

**Confidence in the specific P&L numbers**: Medium — the biggest unknown is whether the volume increase will be sustained (our only data point is a 4-week promo with marketing support, which overestimates permanent elasticity).

**What would change this conclusion**:
- If real-world elasticity shows +25%+ sustained growth → the aggressive scenario becomes achievable
- If Competitor A is slow to respond (>4 weeks) → volume advantage persists longer
- If subscription growth is unaffected → remove the second-order risk from the model
