# Hints: VOICE Stage

---

## Level 1 — Direction

You have three scenarios with P&L numbers. Now you need to communicate them to an audience that includes a growth-focused CEO, a margin-focused CFO, and a capacity-focused Head of Operations — all in the same room. How do you frame uncertainty without making it feel like you're being non-committal?

---

## Level 2 — Specific

Three things to do in VOICE for a Simulation:

1. **Present the 3-scenario summary table** — Don't bury the scenarios. Lead with a clear side-by-side table showing monthly P&L impact for Conservative, Neutral, and Aggressive. Label it so every stakeholder can read it in 10 seconds.

2. **Name the breakeven** — "We break even at +13% sustained order increase. Our promo showed +15% in week 4, which is just above breakeven. The full +22% headline is a best-case figure, not our planning basis." This one sentence gives the CFO what they need and frames the risk correctly.

3. **Offer handle bars** — Don't just present one set of numbers. Tell the board: "You can adjust three inputs: the assumed order volume increase, the subscription conversion impact, and the rider cost discount. Here's how each one changes the outcome." This gives the CEO a way to stress-test optimistic assumptions and gives the CFO a way to stress-test downside.

**Audience-specific messaging:**
- CEO: Lead with the opportunity (the volume upside, competitive positioning)
- CFO: Lead with the breakeven and the downside floor
- Operations: Lead with the capacity plan and what each scenario requires in terms of rider hiring

**Phased recommendation:** Don't recommend the full ₩1,500 cut immediately. Propose starting at ₩2,000 (a 33% reduction) in one city for 4 weeks. This gives you real data on sustained volume increase before committing company-wide.

## Level 3 — Near-Answer

**3-Scenario Summary Table:**

| | Conservative | Neutral | Aggressive |
|-|-------------|---------|------------|
| Sustained order increase | +12% | +18% | +25% |
| Monthly P&L vs baseline | −₩70M | +₩130M | +₩430M |
| vs breakeven (+13%) | Below | Above | Well above |
| Rider capacity | OK (93%) | Tight (98%) | Exceeds — hire now |

**Breakeven line:** "The policy breaks even at approximately +13% sustained order increase. Our best evidence — the week 4 promo data — shows +15%. We're above breakeven in the neutral case, but only by 2pp. That's a narrow margin."

**Handle bars to present:**
- "If you believe order volume increase will be 10% (not 18%), we lose ₩190M/month."
- "If subscription conversion drops 2pp instead of 1pp, add ₩40M/month in lost margin."
- "If we negotiate a 10% rider cost discount at scale, we gain ₩31M/month."

**Phased recommendation framing:**
- "Rather than committing company-wide to ₩1,500, we propose a 4-week test at ₩2,000 in Seoul only. This gives us real elasticity data before a full rollout, and limits downside to one market."
