## Presentation Context

- **Setting**: Board-level strategy meeting, next week
- **Format**: Slide deck + verbal walkthrough, ~30 minutes
- **Audience**: CEO, CFO, Head of Operations (all three in the same room)
- **Stakes**: This decision will be presented to the Board of Directors immediately after internal alignment

The CEO has already mentioned the fee reduction to a journalist informally. There is external expectation pressure, but no public announcement has been made.

## Stakeholder Profiles

### CEO — Growth-Focused
- Primary concern: Market share vs Competitor A
- Wants to see: Order volume projections, market positioning upside
- Risk tolerance: High — willing to accept short-term margin pressure for growth
- Will push back on: Conservative scenarios that "feel too pessimistic"
- Communication style: Big picture first, then details on request

### CFO — Margin-Focused
- Primary concern: Monthly P&L impact, payback period
- Wants to see: Breakeven analysis, worst-case downside, cash flow timing
- Risk tolerance: Low — needs a floor on the downside
- Will push back on: Aggressive scenarios without risk quantification
- Communication style: Numbers first, then narrative

### Head of Operations — Capacity-Focused
- Primary concern: Whether the rider fleet can absorb the volume surge
- Wants to see: Order volume by scenario vs capacity ceiling, hiring plan timeline
- Risk tolerance: Medium — willing to scale, but needs lead time
- Will push back on: Any scenario that implies immediate volume surge without a ramp plan
- Communication style: Operational timeline, concrete milestones

## Rider Capacity Summary (for Operations)

| Scenario | Projected Daily Orders | vs Capacity (18K/day) | Action Needed |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Conservative (+12%) | 16,800 | Within capacity (93%) | No immediate hiring |
| Neutral (+18%) | 17,700 | Within capacity (98%) | Alert threshold, monitor closely |
| Aggressive (+25%) | 18,750 | **Exceeds capacity** | Must pre-hire before launch |

Hiring plan: To add capacity to 20,000 orders/day, need ~150 additional riders. At current hiring pace: 3-4 weeks minimum. Recommendation: Begin onboarding process before fee reduction launches if the aggressive scenario is considered possible.

## Handle Bar Variables (Board Can Adjust)

These are the inputs the board may want to stress-test live during the meeting:

| Variable | Base Case | Range |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Sustained order volume increase | +18% | +10% to +30% |
| Subscription conversion change | −1pp | −3pp to +1pp |
| Rider cost variable discount | −5% | 0% to −10% |
| Competitor response lag | 2 weeks | 1 week to never |

If the board asks "what if volume only goes up 10%?" — you should be able to answer immediately. Pre-calculate the P&L at the key breakeven threshold.

## Key Narrative Framing

**The fundamental question** is not "is this a good idea?" but "under what conditions is this a good idea, and how do we set up a test to find out?"

The phased recommendation reframes the risk:
- Instead of "cut fees from ₩3,000 to ₩1,500 company-wide," propose:
  - **Phase 1**: Test at ₩2,000 in one city for 4 weeks (partial reduction, lower risk)
  - **Phase 2**: Evaluate. If results hit the neutral scenario, roll out ₩1,500 company-wide
  - **Phase 3**: Monitor competitor response and subscription impact for 8 weeks post-rollout

This approach gives the CEO a "yes" (we're moving forward), gives the CFO a "guardrails" story, and gives Operations the ramp time they need.
