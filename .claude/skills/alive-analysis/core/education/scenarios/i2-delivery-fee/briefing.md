# Scenario Briefing: "Should we lower delivery fees?"

## Your Role
You are a data analyst at **QuickBite**, a food delivery marketplace operating in a major metro area. QuickBite handles **15,000 daily orders** with an average order value (AOV) of **₩25,000**.

The CEO has just called a strategy meeting. You have 5 days to prepare a full analysis.

## The Proposal

> "Our biggest competitor is eating into our market share with lower delivery fees. I want to cut our delivery fee from ₩3,000 to ₩1,500 — that's 50% off. This should bring in more orders and grow GMV. Let's do it." — CEO

The **Head of Finance** is worried:

> "That's ₩1,500 per order we're giving up. At 15,000 orders a day, that's ₩22.5M in revenue we're cutting daily. The order volume increase needs to be massive and sustained to justify this. I need to see the numbers." — CFO

The **Head of Operations** has a different concern:

> "If orders jump 20%, our current rider fleet maxes out. We'd need to hire fast and that takes weeks. There's a real capacity ceiling here." — Head of Operations

## Current Business Context

- **Daily orders**: 15,000
- **Average order value (AOV)**: ₩25,000
- **Current delivery fee**: ₩3,000 (flat rate, all orders)
- **Current delivery margin**: ₩800 per order after rider costs
  - Delivery fee revenue: ₩3,000
  - Rider cost per delivery: ₩2,200 (avg)
  - Net delivery margin: ₩800
- **Platform commission**: 15% of GMV (₩3,750 per avg order)
- **Subscription plan**: 12% of active users are subscribers (free delivery included)

## Available Data

You have access to:

1. **Order data** — 6 months of daily/monthly order history (volume, GMV, delivery fee revenue)
2. **Past promotion results** — A "50% delivery fee discount" promo run last quarter (4-week campaign)
3. **Competitor benchmarks** — Public pricing data for Competitor A and Competitor B
4. **Rider cost structure** — Fixed + variable cost breakdown, volume discount thresholds
5. **Subscription analytics** — Subscriber vs non-subscriber order frequency and conversion rates

## Your Task

Conduct a **Full Simulation analysis** using the ALIVE framework.

This is NOT an investigation (nothing went wrong). This is a **policy evaluation**: you need to model what will likely happen if QuickBite implements the fee reduction, across multiple scenarios, and give the leadership team the information they need to decide.

**Deliverables**:
- A scenario model with Conservative, Neutral, and Aggressive projections
- Monthly P&L impact for each scenario
- A breakeven analysis (what sustained order increase makes this worthwhile?)
- A recommendation with a phased approach option
- Handle bars the board can adjust during discussion

---

## Timeline

5 days (Full analysis format — 5 ALIVE stages across 5 files)

## Key Challenge

Multiple variables are uncertain:
- Will the volume increase be sustained (the promo effect fades over time)?
- Will competitors match the lower fee, eliminating the advantage?
- Will subscription conversion accelerate, changing the revenue mix?
- Can operations scale fast enough to serve the volume increase?

Your job is to make the uncertainty visible and bounded — not to hide it in a single-point estimate.
