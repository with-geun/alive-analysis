# Hints: LOOK Stage

## Level 1 — Direction
You have overall numbers (Flow A: 32%, Flow B: 38%). Before drawing any conclusions, think about whether those totals could be hiding something. Averages can deceive.

## Level 2 — Specific
Break the data down by **acquisition channel** (Organic, Paid Instagram, Paid Google). Users from different channels behave very differently — Organic users often have higher intent than Paid users. If Flow B was routed more heavily to high-intent Organic users, the overall improvement might not actually reflect Flow B being better.

This is called **Simpson's Paradox**: a trend that appears in the overall data can disappear or reverse when you look at subgroups.

## Level 3 — Near-answer
Check each channel separately:

| Segment | Flow A | Flow B | Users (A / B) |
|---------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Organic | ? | ? | 3,200 / 2,800 |
| Paid IG | ? | ? | 1,500 / 1,200 |
| Paid Google | ? | ? | 900 / 850 |

The question to answer: does Flow B outperform Flow A **within every channel**, or only in the totals?

If Flow B wins in every channel independently, there is no Simpson's Paradox, and the overall result is trustworthy. If Flow B only wins because it was over-represented in higher-converting channels, you have a confounding problem that changes the recommendation.

Also check: are the sample sizes large enough to draw conclusions? A 4pp difference on n=150 is very different from the same gap on n=3,000.
