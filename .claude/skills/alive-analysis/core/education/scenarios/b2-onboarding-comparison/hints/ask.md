# Hints: ASK Stage

## Level 1 — Direction
The PM is asking you to choose between two options. Think carefully about what *type* of question this is before you start pulling data. The framing of your question determines what methods and metrics are appropriate.

## Level 2 — Specific
This is a **Comparison** question ("Which is better, A or B?"), not a Causation question ("Why did X happen?"). That matters because:
- Comparison requires you to define "better" — better at what? By which metric?
- The PM's implied metric (signup completion rate) may not be the only thing that matters
- Ask yourself: is there a metric that could move in the *wrong direction* even if signup rate improves?

## Level 3 — Near-answer
Frame your question as: "Which onboarding flow produces more high-quality signups?" — not just more signups. This forces you to identify at least two metrics up front:
1. **Primary metric**: Signup completion rate (the PM's stated concern)
2. **Counter-metric**: D7 activation rate (do those signups actually use the product?)

Identifying the counter-metric in ASK is the mark of a careful analyst. Optimizing signup rate alone could attract more low-intent users if the simpler flow removes a barrier that was actually filtering for intent.
