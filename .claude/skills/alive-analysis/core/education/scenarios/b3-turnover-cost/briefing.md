# Scenario Briefing: "How much does turnover cost us?"

## Your Role
You are a data analyst supporting the **HR team at Meridian Engineering**, a mid-sized tech company with 250 engineers. The HR Director has reached out by email:

> "Hi — our engineering turnover jumped from 12% to 19% this year and leadership is starting to ask questions. I have a budget review with the CFO in three days and I need hard numbers. She's not going to accept 'turnover is bad.' Can you help me put together something concrete — total cost, where it's concentrated, what's driving it? I need to walk in with a credible story."

## Context
- Engineering headcount: 250 total across three seniority levels (Junior L1-L2, Mid L3-L4, Senior L5+)
- Overall annual turnover rose from 12% last year to 19% this year (48 departures)
- The CFO has approved discretionary budget reviews before but expects ROI framing, not anecdotes
- HR has been tracking exit interview themes for the past 18 months
- The People Ops team runs an eNPS survey every quarter

## Available Data
You have access to:
1. **HRIS export** — headcount and departure counts by level, this year vs last year
2. **Finance cost reports** — replacement cost estimates by level (recruiting, onboarding, lost productivity)
3. **Exit interview summaries** — themes by level, self-reported reasons for leaving
4. **eNPS scores** — most recent quarter, by level
5. **Industry benchmarks** — average turnover rates by seniority for tech companies

## Your Task
Use the ALIVE loop to:
1. Quantify the total financial impact of engineering turnover this year
2. Identify which level(s) are the biggest cost drivers
3. Diagnose the root cause(s) per level
4. Recommend prioritized interventions the HR Director can defend to the CFO with cost and expected savings

## Deadline
3 days (this is a Quick analysis — one file, ALIVE loop end to end)
