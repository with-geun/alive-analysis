# Hints: EVOLVE Stage

## Level 1 (Direction)
This analysis is a point-in-time snapshot. What would you want to check in 3 months to know whether the situation is getting better or worse — before the next round of departures happens?

## Level 2 (Specific)
Think about leading indicators vs lagging indicators. Turnover rate is a lagging indicator — by the time it rises, people have already left. What data exists right now that could signal whether mid-level dissatisfaction is worsening? What should you do before designing the career ladder program?

Also: could this analysis template be reused? This is the first time HR turnover was analyzed this way at your company. What would make it easier to run next time?

## Level 3 (Near-answer)
**Follow-up action**: Survey current mid-level engineers on career development satisfaction (anonymous pulse survey, 5-10 questions, before designing any program). Exit interview data tells you why people left — it doesn't tell you how the people who stayed feel. A targeted survey validates the diagnosis with live data and gives HR a baseline to measure the program against.

**Leading indicators to monitor quarterly**:
- eNPS by level (most important: Mid-level score is 22 today — if it drops below 20, escalate)
- Internal promotion rate for L3-L4 (are people actually advancing, or stagnating?)

**Lagging indicator to monitor**:
- Turnover rate by level, quarterly (not just annual)

**Counter-metric**: Time-to-fill for open roles by level. If the job market tightens further, replacement costs will increase beyond current estimates.

**Reusable insight**: Aggregate turnover rate hides fundamentally different problems at different levels. Any future turnover analysis should always segment by seniority first. Consider setting up a quarterly automated report (HRIS export + this cost model) so the HR Director has this view without a full analyst engagement every time.
