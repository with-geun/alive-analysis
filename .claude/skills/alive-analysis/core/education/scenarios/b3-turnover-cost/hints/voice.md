# Hints: VOICE Stage

## Level 1 (Direction)
You have two audiences here: the HR Director (who you're helping) and the CFO (who will receive the output). Who should your analysis be written for? What does each one care about?

## Level 2 (Specific)
The CFO cares about: total cost, ROI of proposed interventions, and risk. She does not need to hear about employee feelings or abstract culture concerns. Frame every recommendation with: "If we invest $X, we expect to save $Y." Lead with the total number, then break it down.

The HR Director needs the full diagnosis, but the executive summary should be CFO-ready.

Confidence calibration matters here: cost estimates are based on actual departure counts and established industry benchmarks (high confidence), but root causes come from self-reported exit interviews (medium confidence). Say this explicitly.

## Level 3 (Near-answer)
**So What**: Engineering turnover cost an estimated $3.02M this year, up from roughly $1.5M last year. The highest-impact segment is mid-level engineers ($1.36M, 45% of total cost), whose turnover doubled from 10% to 20% — driven primarily by lack of career growth paths, not compensation. Senior turnover is concentrated: 3 of 5 departures went to the same competitor and represent a targeted poaching risk.

**Now What**:
- **Priority 1 — Mid-level career ladder** ($200K/year investment): A structured promotion track and mentorship program. If it reduces mid-level turnover by just 5 percentage points (from 20% to 15%), that saves approximately $400K/year in avoided replacement costs. 2:1 ROI minimum in year one.
- **Priority 2 — Senior targeted retention** ($50-80K one-time): Retention packages for the 3-5 senior engineers most likely to be targeted by Apex Systems. Cost of one additional senior departure is $150K.
- **Monitor**: Quarterly turnover rate by level (lagging), eNPS by level (leading)

**Confidence**: High for cost figures (actual headcount + industry-validated replacement cost estimates). Medium for root causes — exit interview self-reporting bias means "lack of career path" at 70% should be treated as directionally correct, not precise.
