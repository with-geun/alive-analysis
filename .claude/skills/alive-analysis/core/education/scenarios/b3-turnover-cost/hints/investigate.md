# Hints: INVESTIGATE Stage

## Level 1 (Direction)
Different levels are leaving for different reasons. Don't treat all 48 departures as the same problem. What does the data tell you separately for Junior, Mid, and Senior?

## Level 2 (Specific)
Look at the exit interview themes alongside the eNPS scores and tenure data — they tell a more complete story together. For each level, ask:
- What is the primary stated reason for leaving?
- Does the eNPS score match that story?
- How long were people staying before they left?
- How does this level's turnover compare to the industry benchmark?

Also: exit interview data has a known bias. People underreport sensitive reasons (management problems, culture issues) and may report socially acceptable reasons (compensation, better opportunity) even when that's not the full story.

## Level 3 (Near-answer)
Three distinct patterns emerge:

**Junior (L1-L2)**: 50% cite compensation, 22% turnover vs 20% industry average. This is near-benchmark — early-career movement is normal in tech. The competitor salary increases in Q3 probably explain some of this. Not the priority.

**Mid (L3-L4)**: 70% cite lack of career growth path. Turnover doubled from 10% to 20% vs industry average of 12%. eNPS of 22 is the company's lowest recorded score in 18 months — a strong leading indicator that this problem is ongoing, not a one-time event. Tenure of 2.8 years means they're leaving after investing real time at the company. This is an internal structural problem, not a market one.

**Senior (L5+)**: 3 of 5 departures went to the same competitor (Apex Systems). This is targeted poaching, not organic attrition. The eNPS of 45 is healthy — seniors who remain are satisfied. The problem is a concentrated external threat, not a broad dissatisfaction signal.

Exit interview bias caveat: Mid-level engineers may underreport management dissatisfaction (15% cited it, but the true figure could be higher). Don't treat the 70% "growth path" figure as perfectly precise.
