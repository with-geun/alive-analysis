## ASK — 20 points

| Criterion | Points | What to Look For |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Quantification framing | 8 | Analysis is framed as "how much" and "where" — not "why did turnover increase" (causation) or "is turnover a problem" (comparison). The question specifies a dollar impact and a priority segment. |
| Level segmentation identified upfront | 6 | Recognizes before looking at data that 19% aggregate turnover must be broken down by level to be actionable. Does not treat 48 departures as a uniform group. |
| CFO audience awareness | 6 | Explicitly notes the output must speak to cost and ROI, not employee sentiment. Frames the analysis to support a budget conversation, not an HR review. |

**Common ASK mistakes**: Framing as pure causation ("why did turnover increase?"); not identifying the CFO as the real audience; treating aggregate turnover rate as sufficient without planning to segment.

## LOOK — 20 points

| Criterion | Points | What to Look For |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Cost calculation by level (arithmetic) | 8 | Correctly computes: Junior $910K, Mid $1.36M, Senior $750K, Total $3.02M. All three levels calculated, not just the aggregate. |
| Mid-level identified as biggest cost driver | 7 | Notes that Mid has the highest total cost ($1.36M) despite fewer departures than Junior (17 vs 26), and that Mid turnover doubled (10%→20%). Explains why: high replacement cost ($80K) × moderate volume. |
| External factor check | 5 | Notes competitor salary increases (15% in Q3) and industry hiring surge as relevant context. Does not over-index on external factors to explain away the entire increase — distinguishes which segments they apply to. |

**Common LOOK mistakes**: Only reporting percentages without computing dollar amounts; concluding Junior is the biggest problem because it has the most departures; treating the competitor salary increase as a full explanation for all three levels.

## INVESTIGATE — 25 points

| Criterion | Points | What to Look For |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Level-specific root cause analysis | 10 | Identifies three distinct patterns: Junior = compensation + market movement (near-benchmark, lower priority); Mid = career growth path (structural, internal, above benchmark); Senior = targeted poaching by one competitor (concentrated, external). Does not conflate the three. |
| Mid-level analysis depth | 7 | Connects 70% exit theme (career path) + eNPS of 22 (lowest in 18 months) + 2.8-year tenure + 8pp above industry benchmark into a coherent diagnosis of a structural career path problem. Recognizes this is not compensation-driven. |
| Exit interview bias awareness | 5 | Notes that exit interview self-reporting understates sensitive reasons. Treats the 70% and 15% figures as directional, not precise. Ideally notes that eNPS and tenure data independently corroborate the career path hypothesis. |
| Industry benchmark comparison | 3 | Compares each level's turnover to the industry benchmark (Junior 22% vs 20%, Mid 20% vs 12%, Senior 12% vs 8%). Identifies Mid as the most significant underperformer. |

**Common INVESTIGATE mistakes**: Treating all departures as having the same cause; not connecting eNPS to the exit interview themes; ignoring exit interview bias; skipping the industry benchmark comparison.

## VOICE — 20 points

| Criterion | Points | What to Look For |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| ROI framing for CFO | 8 | Recommendations are expressed as investment ($X/year) vs expected savings ($Y/year avoided replacement costs), not as "we should care about our people." Explicitly calculates the break-even or return on Priority 1. |
| Specific actionable recommendations with costs | 7 | Priority 1 (Mid career ladder: $200K/year investment, ~$320-400K/year savings at 5pp reduction) and Priority 2 (Senior retention packages: $50-80K one-time, covers cost of one departure at $150K). Both have a stated cost and a stated expected outcome. |
| Confidence calibration | 5 | Explicitly distinguishes High confidence (cost figures based on actual data) from Medium confidence (root causes from exit interviews with self-reporting bias). Does not present all findings with equal certainty. |

**Common VOICE mistakes**: Recommendations without cost estimates; framing around employee wellbeing rather than financial ROI for CFO; presenting root cause findings with the same confidence as cost figures; recommending across-the-board compensation increases without noting this doesn't address the Mid-level cause.

## EVOLVE — 15 points

| Criterion | Points | What to Look For |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Leading indicator setup (eNPS) | 6 | Identifies eNPS by level as a leading indicator to monitor quarterly. Specifically flags Mid eNPS at 22 as a warning zone and sets a threshold (below 20 = escalate). Distinguishes eNPS (leading) from turnover rate (lagging). |
| Follow-up plan (survey current mid-level) | 5 | Proposes surveying current L3-L4 engineers before designing the career ladder program. Recognizes exit data only reflects people who left — not the state of people who stayed. |
| Reusable insight | 4 | Articulates the generalizable principle: aggregate turnover rate hides different problems at different levels; future turnover analysis should always segment by seniority. Bonus: proposes standardizing this as a recurring quarterly report. |

**Common EVOLVE mistakes**: Only identifying lagging indicators (turnover rate) without leading indicators (eNPS); not proposing a follow-up action that validates the diagnosis with current employees; not extracting a reusable pattern from the analysis.

## Scoring Guide

| Score Range | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|
| 90-100 | Exceptional — CFO-ready output, all five stages executed with precision, confidence correctly calibrated, leading indicators identified |
| 75-89 | Proficient — Core cost calculation correct, level segmentation present, recommendations actionable; minor gaps in bias awareness or leading indicators |
| 60-74 | Developing — Cost calculation attempted but incomplete or aggregate only; root causes identified but not differentiated by level; recommendations lack cost/ROI framing |
| Below 60 | Needs revision — Analysis stays at the aggregate level (19% turnover rate) without segmentation; recommendations are generic or sentiment-based; no leading indicators |

## Most Common Mistakes at Beginner Level

1. **Using aggregate turnover rate only** — Reporting "19% turnover" without segmenting by seniority level. The aggregate hides that Junior (12%), Mid (28%), and Senior (15%) have completely different patterns and causes.

2. **Treating all departures as one cost** — Not differentiating replacement cost by level. Replacing a Senior engineer ($150K+) costs 3x more than a Junior ($50K). The cost structure drives which problem to fix first.

3. **Taking exit interview data at face value** — Not noting that exit interviews have self-reporting bias (people give socially acceptable reasons). This doesn't invalidate the data but requires a confidence caveat.

4. **Recommending "raise salaries" generically** — Not targeting the specific root cause per level. Mid-level churn is driven by career progression gaps, not compensation. The intervention must match the diagnosis.

5. **Framing recommendations emotionally instead of as ROI** — Presenting "we should care about retention" instead of "$3.02M annual cost, fixable by investing $200K in career ladder program for 60-100% ROI." CFOs need numbers.
